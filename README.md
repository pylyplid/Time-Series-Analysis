1) **NI_SCR_AR(2)_proces** - This project investigates the behavior of **second-order autoregressive models (AR(2))** depending on the position of their characteristic equation roots.   The work visualizes how different root types (real, complex, inside/outside the unit circle) affect the **stability** and **dynamics** of the AR(2) process.
2) **Selling prices of Soft wheat** - ARIMA and statistical testes.
