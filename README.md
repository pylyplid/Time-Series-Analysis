# Time-Series-Analysis
This project investigates the behavior of **second-order autoregressive models (AR(2))** depending on the position of their characteristic equation roots.   The work visualizes how different root types (real, complex, inside/outside the unit circle) affect the **stability** and **dynamics** of the AR(2) process.
